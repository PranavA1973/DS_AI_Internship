    "Machine Learning is a way of programming where instead of explicitly writing rules for the computer to follow, we provide it with data and the correct outputs, and it learns the underlying patterns on its own. In traditional programming, humans define the logic step by step, but in machine learning, algorithms analyze examples to discover the rules that map inputs to outputs. Once trained, the model can apply these learned patterns to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data."
